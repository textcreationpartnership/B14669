            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

True it is, that most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the rod that brings vs vnto God. For the flouds of affliction, and the trying fire of aduersitie, are to no other end sent from God vnto his children, then by the one to wash their vncleannesse, and by the other
<pb facs="tcp:176877:5"/>to purge their drosse, whereby they might be made as pure and perfect Gold, fit for the heauenly temple of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Difference there is, betweene pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and affliction: by the one God in his wrath rooteth out for to destroy, but by the other he correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his loue for to restore: the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares seruice doubled vpon <hi>Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob</hi> was to make him rich; but the seauen yeares famine sent vpon Egipt was to make them poore. <hi>Iosephs</hi> imprisonment was for his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Bakers for his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Daniels</hi> casting into the Den was for his glory, but the throwing in of his accusers was for their shame: Christ his crosse was <hi>Pauls</hi> crowne, but a stumbling blocke to <hi>Iudas</hi> to throw him downe: murmure brings misery, but patience felicity.</p>

            <p>Wherfore thy afflicted friend (most Christian Reader) doth counsel thee to pray in thy aduersity, &amp; thou shalt be comforted, to beleeue, and thou shalt obtaine, and to performe thy <hi>Vowes</hi> which thou hast made vnto the Lord thy God: the which lest thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest forget, and bring a punishment vpon thee, I here present them vnto thee, being as it were the copie of the couenants which thou hast made and sealed vp in thy baptisme vnto God.

<note place="margin">None, but haue some affliction.</note> and the wetting of the dew, the grace of reuiuing.
